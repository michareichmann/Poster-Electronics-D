	The figure above shows all the main devices provided for this experiment. In addition also several kinds of cables and passive components such as resistors and capacitors are available at the experimental site. The active components, the \acp{IC} (e.g. logic gates), and a variety of other useful materials to build electronic circuits have to be requested from the assistants. An important objective of this experiment is to get familiar with the essential tools in electronics labs such as multimeters, oscilloscopes, signal generators, etc.
