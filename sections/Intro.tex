\posterbox{Abstract}{
	Digital electronics can be thought of as dealing with a world that is either black or white (or 0/1 or true/false or low/high), with no fuzzy grey areas between those levels. Whereas analogue design is the art of working in those grey areas.\\[1ex]
	Digital electronic circuits are usually made from assemblies of logic gates (often printed on integrated circuits), which are simple electronic representations of Boolean logic functions.\\[1ex]
	In this experiment the you will learn how to operate logic gates and their basic functionality. At the end you should be able to build a stand-alone digital circuit they, which you can design from your own imagination.
