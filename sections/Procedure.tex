\posterbox{Experimental Procedure}{\vspace*{1ex}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Investigation of a single logic gate}\\ Using the corresponding datasheet, you have to understand the powering of the circuit and verify the specified behaviour.\vspace*{.5ex}
		\item \textbf{Construction of a pulse generator}\\ Based on instructions you have to build an astable multivibrator. By drawing a time-diagram the working principle has to be understood and the limits of the circuit have to be explored by varying the values of the used components.\vspace*{.5ex}
		\item \textbf{Building a stand-alone circuit}\\ You are is encouraged to think about your own circuit but can also choose from a list of already realised experiments. After consulting with the assistant, you have to realise the circuit and demonstrate its functionality.
